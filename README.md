# Black-Chicago-BusinessBot
Black Chicago BusinessBot is a Twitter bot that sends tweets whenever a new business license is issued within the City of Chicago for a location within a majority-Black ward. The tweet will contain the business name, what kind of service(s) it provides, when it received a license and at what location the license was issued. There are 18 wards within Chicago where the majority of the population is Black. Although the businesses themselves may not be Black-owned, they still provide one indicator of the level of economic development in Black communities in Chicago.
